            Hello wassup! How are you all tenthies...Hopefully your boards are
            Going well. Mine are like I have no words what to say what to not
            they are just ok. I love to be a part of Roop Nagar Public School
            but it's hard to leave it. I have a problem I don't confide in
            people that easily and making friends oh my god it's same as
            cracking JEE for a 8th class student as for an introvert. Sometimes
            I think why I have people in my life they must not be here common
            you all deserve better friends. I have only few people who I can
            call real friends but nobody knows me Neither my parents, my family
            nor my friends. And if they know about how much I suffered they
            don't know me who is me? Who is there? Huh all so complicated...
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing is that I went to Pune for a ROBOTICS COMPETITION there we
            were total of 5 students 4 of same class. We played several games
            like the most popular Truth and Dare, UNO, etc. I felt a change in
            myself I confided in a person I had never talked before as a friend
            and out of no where I opened my heart in front of him. I don't know
            why (But everything happens for a reason) I told him everything like
            seriously. He knows much about me. The things I never talked of I
            shared with him and almost everything. It was a dream of me to have
            a good friend because I don't talk to people and share what's going
            on in my mind that easily to anyone, But yes I told him everything
            like what happened with me in past and the future I am worried about
            and all.
          </p>
          <p>
            But today was my Science Board Examination not only mine but of
            every student studying in CBSE class 10. One of my friend the one
            with whom I for the first time shared something in class 9 like i
            opened myself for the first time in front of somebody that How I am
            feeling what's going on in my mind and all. Mumma told me that she
            saw her coming out of the center when her face was showing
            everything, I also met her before the Examination and she was really
            too much anxious. I don't know exactly what I felt at that moment
            but all the ssatisfaction like the one I have after successfully
            crossing this valley of Science it all vanished and I became too
            much worried. I texted her as soon as possible for me. And gathered
            courage to call her. Its dramatic that you can't call your friend
            and talk normally. I know this but I just hate myself. Cause I have
            reason for this too: THE DARK PAST......
